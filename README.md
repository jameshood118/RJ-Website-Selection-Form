# Raymond James Website Selection form
This was written in a variety of languages (html/css, javascript, jquery, angular, asp) I took over the project and re-wrote it from the ground up based on current requirements. This repo will serve as a back up for this form.

# Most recent update
on 10/30/3017 I started work cleaning up the styles and using this as a jumping off point for using SASS, i am using Koala as my compiler with visual studio code as my IDE.

Initial thoughts, very powerful, allowed me to clean up some of the more odd styles, even though they still end up being the same thing when compiled, this allows for a much better organizational pattern. The only issues i forsee is when someone else takes on the project after me, they may not know SASS, and as such the files will probably get out of sync quickly, but so long as I am maintaining it, this is the direction I want to go
